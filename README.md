# Sims4-DRP
Discord Rich Presence for The Sims 4

This program uses help from a few sources of the web:<br>
- https://github.com/niveshbirangal/discord-rpc for a simple Discord API wrapper that works with Sims limited libraries
- https://modthesims.info/showthread.php?p=4751246 for help with hooking into functions and injecting the discord code
- https://lot51.cc/ for Sims 4 injector for on_load, buildbuy functions
- https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence for a few edits of the code to make it runner better & easier

The mod currently does:
- Show when in Build/Buy (with small images for gamemode(build/buy & live))
- Show household money and updates when it changes

Future Plans for it are:
- Show when in CAS(have no clue on this yet)
- Configuration file for choosing to show household name, funds etc(already started just been lazy).

A warning:
I am not very well versed in Sims 4 modding. There is not too much documentation so many of these things are trial/error and finding code snippets to work off.
No idea if this works on Mac, I assume it will as the rpc has support for Unix and Mac is Unix based so it should. No promises though.
