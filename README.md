# Sims4-DRP
Discord Rich Presence for The Sims 4

This program uses help from a few sources of the web:<br>
- https://github.com/niveshbirangal/discord-rpc for a simple Discord API wrapper that works with Sims limited libraries
- https://modthesims.info/showthread.php?p=4751246 for help with hooking into functions and injecting the discord code
- https://lot51.cc/ for Sims 4 injector for on_load, buildbuy functions
- https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence for a few edits of the code to make it runner better & easier

The program ATM only does on main menu function and when loading it. Future features are:
- ~~Show when in Build/Buy(already have the function for it)~~ Also now added with small images for gamemode(build/buy & live)
- ~~Show household money and update when it changes~~ Added now
- Show when in CAS(have no clue on this yet)

A warning:
I am not very well versed in Sims 4 modding. There is not too much documentation so many of these things are trial/error and finding code snippers to work off.
No idea if this works on Mac, I assume it will as the rpc has support for Unix and Mac is Unix based it should. No promises though.
